# 🛡️ AWS Cloud Security Operations Lab

This project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** using **AWS services** to detect and respond to cloud-based threats. It demonstrates setting up:

- EC2 instance (as an asset)
- Amazon GuardDuty (for threat detection)
- AWS Security Hub (for centralized findings)

## 🚀 Objectives

- Simulate real-world threat scenarios (e.g., SSH brute force)
- Use GuardDuty to automatically detect threats
- Aggregate findings in Security Hub for analysis
- Learn foundational skills in Cloud SOC operations
